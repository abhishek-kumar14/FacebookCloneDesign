# Facebook Clone Design
The project aims to create a Facebook clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project will involve designing and implementing the front-end of a Facebook-like social networking site.
The primary objective of this project is to provide a user interface that closely resembles the actual Facebook website.
The front-end will be developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML will be used for the site's structure and layout. CSS will be used to style the site, while JavaScript will be used to add interactivity and functionality to the site.
